            <p class="bold">The role played by time at the beginning of the universe is,
              I believe, the final key to removing the need for a Grand Designer,
              and revealing how the universe created itself. ... Time itself must come
              to a stop. You can’t get to a time before the big bang, because there
              was no time before the big bang. We have finally found something that
              does not have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist
              in. For me this means there is no possibility of a creator because there
              is no time for a creator to have existed. Since time itself began
              at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have
              been caused or created by anyone or anything. ... So when people ask me
              if a god created the universe, I tell them the question itself makes
              no sense. Time didn't exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for
              God to make the universe in. It's like asking for directions to the edge
              of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere. It does not have an edge, so looking
              for it is a futile exercise.</p>
